Lets plan this yo

Okay so what objects am I going to need
At bare minimum I need character objects 
I potentially might need a player object

okay so characters, here's what I'm thinking:

the jock (m)
the popular girl (f)
the emo (f)
the nerd (f)
the class clown (m)
the bad boy (m)
the soulmate (m/f)

okay cool I have characters now what traits should they have
Im thinking:

name
gender
attraction
likes
dislikes
(maybe social standing)

okay so as a player you might have these traits
name
popularity
confidence
luck

I'm also gonna need situations as well as an overarching story
